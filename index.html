            <h3><b>Ankylosaurus</b></h3>
            <p>Ankylosaurus is my favorite dinosaur because they seem as if they were the puppy dogs of dinosaurs. Short
                and stubby and somewhat playful looking. I have always had a liking to this dinosaur ever since I was a child.
                The hard shell on their back for protections and the hug club tail for smashing enemies.</p>
